## Background
Addiction Abstraction is a piece I composed for Prof. Rezvani's PSY 190 class on addiction. This piece is meant to reflect the struggles of what I conceive people who are addicted to a substance goes through. This is my debut piece, so it is not perfect (and I know it). I plan to revisit this composition maybe a few years later, like how I revisited my [Cuphead arrangement](../2020-06-01-cuphead-arrangement) two years later after I made it.
