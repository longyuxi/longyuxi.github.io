### Background
It was the end of my high school sophomore year. I remembered that I found the transcription to that video a while ago, but I could no longer find it. I somehow felt guilty that I lost it, so I spent a whole afternoon transcribing and putting the notes of arrangment of Tabei's version of Romance de Amor.
