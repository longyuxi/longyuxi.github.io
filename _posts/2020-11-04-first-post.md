# Here we go...

I have done many random things. Somehow, I never before thought of the idea of creating a personal blog. But here it is. I forked this repo from Beautiful Jekyll. I am going to start catching this site up with random things I have done before. Their dates are all going to be the date of today, 11/4/2020.
