My first time as a team leader. All five other team members were girls. Truly exciting experience.

We tackled the problem of loneliness within high school students, and most of us participated in arts of some kind, so we decided that arts might be a way to solve the problem. We did research and found somewhat convincing results (not really), but we decided to make a full presentation out of it and we got first prize.

We have far more research materials than we put on our website. Email me if interested.
