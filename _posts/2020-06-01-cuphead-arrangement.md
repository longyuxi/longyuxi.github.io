### Background
I did this arrangement on the theme music for *Inkwell Isle Two* in the video game *Cuphead* around the same time as my Romance de Amor transcription. In fact, the reason I did this arrangement was that I was so encouraged by the success that I got (mostly seen from the steady gain of views but also the amount of appreciation I received after I shared this sheet music on the forum of GuitarChina). At the time when I first arranged it, it was not really playable. Nor did it sound very good. However, around the end of my senior year in high school, I decided that I would pick up this arrangement again and polish it, so that it's finally playable. Credits to David Han (insta: emtdavid233) for recording it.
