# A standalone program to generate data for Duke's AUVSI 2020 CV subteam

The purpose of our CV project is to observe big, physical letters the competition organizers put on the ground and determine which letters (or shapes) they are. Here, I built a program in Unity that generates the dataset for our model. Partly inspired by [Microsoft's Airsim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) and [UAVs at Berkeley's UnityDroneSim](https://github.com/UAVs-at-Berkeley/UnityDroneSim).
